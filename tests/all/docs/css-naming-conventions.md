## Naming Conventions

Naming conventions in CSS are hugely useful in making your code more strict,
more transparent, and more informative.

A good naming convention will tell you and your team

- what type of thing a class does;
- where a class can be used;
- what (else) a class might be related to.

The naming convention we follow are as follows

- Hyphen (`-`) delimited strings.
- Layer namespacing
- A variation on BEM-like naming for action modifiers

It’s worth noting that not all the naming convention are normally useful
in the CSS-side of development; they really come into their own when viewed in
HTML.

### Hyphen Delimited

All strings in classes are delimited with a hyphen (`-`), like so:

```css
.page-head { }

.sub-content { }
```

Camel case and underscores are not used for regular classes; the following are
incorrect:

```css
.pageHead { }

.sub_content { }
```

### Modified BEM-like Naming

For larger, more interrelated pieces of UI that require a number of classes, we
use a modified BEM-like naming convention.

BEM, meaning Block, Element, Modifier, is a front-end methodology coined by
developers working at Yandex. Whilst BEM is a complete methodology, here we are
only concerned with its naming convention. Further, the naming convention here
only is BEM-like; the principles are exactly the same, but the actual syntax
differs.

BEM splits components’ classes into three groups:

- Block: The sole root of the component.
- Element: A component part of the Block.
- Modifier: A variant or extension of the Block.

To take an analogy (note, not an example):

```css
.dropdown { }
.dropdown-item { }
.dropdown--active { }
```

Elements are delimited with two (hyphens (`-`), and Modifiers are delimited by
two (2) hyphens (`--`).

Here we can see that `.dropdown {}` is the Block; it is the sole root of a
discrete entity. `.dropdown-item {}` is an Element; it is a smaller part of the
`.dropdown {}` Block. Finally, `.dropdown--active {}` is a Modifier; it is a
specific variant of the `.dropdown {}` Block.

#### Starting Context

Your Block context starts at the most logical, self-contained, discrete
location. To continue with our dropdown-based analogy, we’d not have a class
like `.header-dropdown {}`, as the header is another, much higher context. We’d
probably have separate Blocks, like so:

```css
.header { }

.header-nav { }


.dropdown { }

.dropdown-item { }
```

If we did want to denote a `.dropdown {}` inside a `.header {}`, it is more
correct to use a selector like `.header .dropdown {}` which bridges two Blocks
than it is to increase the scope of existing Blocks and Elements.

A more realistic example of properly scoped blocks might look something like
this, where each chunk of code represents its own Block:

```css
.page { }


.content { }


.footer { }

.footer-copyright { }
```

Incorrect notation for this would be:

```css
.page { }

.page-content { }

.page-footer { }

.page-copyright { }
```

It is important to know when BEM scope starts and stops. As a rule, BEM applies
to self-contained, discrete parts of the UI.

#### More Layers

If we were to add another Element—called, let’s say, `.dropdown-link {}`—to
this `.dropdown {}` component, we would not need to step through every layer of
the DOM. That is to say, the correct notation would be `.dropdown-link {}`, and
not `.dropdown-item-link {}`. Your classes do not reflect the full paper-trail
of the DOM.


### Layer Namespacing

There are a number of common problems when working with CSS at scale, but the
major two that namespacing aims to solve are clarity and confidence:

- **Clarity:** How much information can we glean from the smallest possible source? Is our code self-documenting? Can we make safe assumptions from a single context? How much do we have to rely on external or supplementary information in order to learn about a system?
- **Confidence:** Do we have enough knowledge about a system to be able to safely interface with it? Do we know enough about our code to be able to confidently make changes? Do we have a way of knowing the potential side effects of making a change? Do we have a way of knowing what we might be able to remove?

This gets further complicated when dealing with
[ITCSS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OKZOV-iLj4). Knowing what layer a
class is coming from is not always apparent. To combat this and provide complete
transparency we use layer based namespacing.

In no particular order, here are the individual namespaces and a brief
description. We’ll look at each in more detail in a moment, but the following
list should acquaint you.

- `o-`: Signify that something is an Object, and that it may be used in any number of unrelated contexts to the one you can currently see it in. Making modifications to these types of class could potentially have knock-on effects in a lot of other unrelated places. Tread carefully.
- `c-`: Signify that something is a Component. This is a concrete, implementation-specific piece of UI. All of the changes you make to its styles should be detectable in the context you’re currently looking at. Modifying these styles should be safe and have no side effects.
- `u-`: Signify that this class is a Utility class. It has a very specific role (often providing only one declaration) and should not be bound onto or changed. It can be reused and is not tied to any specific piece of UI. You will probably recognise this namespace from libraries and methodologies like [SUITcss](https://suitcss.github.io/).
- `t-`: Signify that a class is responsible for adding a Theme to a view. It lets us know that UI Components’ current cosmetic appearance may be due to the presence of a theme. Vastly improves templating for large projects
- `s-`: Signify that a class creates a new styling context or Scope. Similar to a Theme, but not necessarily cosmetic, these should be used sparingly—they can be open to abuse and lead to poor CSS if not used wisely.
- `is-`, `has-`: Signify that the piece of UI in question is currently styled a certain way because of a state or condition. This stateful namespace is gorgeous, and comes from [SMACSS](https://smacss.com/). It tells us that the DOM currently has a temporary, optional, or short-lived style applied to it due to a certain state being invoked.
- `_`: Signify that this class is the worst of the worst—a hack! Sometimes, although incredibly rarely, we need to add a class in our markup in order to force something to work. If we do this, we need to let others know that this class is less than ideal, and hopefully temporary (i.e. do not bind onto this).
- `js`-: Signify that this piece of the DOM has some behaviour acting upon it, and that JavaScript binds onto it to provide that behaviour. If you’re not a developer working with JavaScript, leave these well alone.

Even from this short list alone, we can see just how much more information we
can communicate to developers simply by placing a character or two at the front
of our existing classes.

### JavaScript Hooks

As a rule, it is unwise to bind your CSS and your JS onto the same class in
your HTML. This is because doing so means you can’t have (or remove) one
without (removing) the other. It is much cleaner, much more transparent, and
much more maintainable to bind your JS onto specific classes.

I have known occasions before when trying to refactor some CSS has unwittingly
removed JS functionality because the two were tied to each other—it was
impossible to have one without the other.

Typically, these are classes that are prepended with `js-`, for example:

```html
<input type="submit" class="btn js-btn" value="Follow" />
```

This means that we can have an element elsewhere which can carry with style of
`.btn {}`, but without the behaviour of `.js-btn`.

#### `data-*` Attributes

A common practice is to use `data-*` attributes as JS hooks, but this is
incorrect. `data-*` attributes, as per the spec, are used to store custom
data private to the page or application'* (emphasis Harry Roberts). `data-*`
attributes are designed to store data, not be bound to.
