# Framework Usage

!> Beofre we cover how to use the framework its best to understand the concepts of [ITCSS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OKZOV-iLj4).

Each layer of [ITCSS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OKZOV-iLj4) has its own
folder. All corresponding partials should be created in the appropriate folder.

- 1. Settings
- 2. Tools
- 3. Generic
- 4. Base
- 5. Objects
- 6. Components
- 7. Theme
- 8. Utilities/Other/Trumps

Then simply import it in the correct _build file_

There are three _build files_ in the main `src/scss` folder. These are the heart
of the framework.

?> For more understanding about why checkout the [About](/about/) section.

Each _build file_ is responsible for a different subset of the layers talked
about in [ITCSS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OKZOV-iLj4)

- **Core**
- **Theme**
- **Utilities**

Each of these has a specific focus or _**"seperation of concerns"**_.

!> Its important to know that the first two layers of [ITCSS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OKZOV-iLj4) are used/imported into each _build file_ as they are globals for the framework. This is not to be confused with the term global for the rendered css.

### Core
The `core.scss` _build file_ which builds the `core.css` file houses the aspects
of your project that rarely change. These are the foundation layers.

- 3. Generic
- 4. Base
- 5. Objects

The first two may be obvious why they belong in **Core**, but for clarification
all _objects_ are included in the core as well as they should be applied first
in selector order building the foundation for your components.

### Theme
The `theme.scss` _build file_ which builds the `theme.css` file houses the all
your components as well as all the themeing. This is essentially the main theme
of your project.

- 6. Component
- 7. Theme

Its meant to be included on top of the `core.css` layer.

### Utilities
The `utilities.scss` _build file_ which builds the `utilities.css` file houses
everything else. Any utility classes, important trumps, etc...
