# at-mixin-no-argumentless-call-parentheses

**Deprecated. Use [`at-mixin-argumentless-call-parentheses`](../at-mixin-argumentless-call-parentheses/README.md) instead.**

Disallow parentheses in argumentless `@mixin` calls.

```scss
@include mixin-name() {
/**                â†‘
 *  Such mixin calls */
```

The following patterns are considered warnings:

```scss
@include mixin-name() {
```

The following patterns are *not* considered warnings:

```scss
@include mixin-name {
```
